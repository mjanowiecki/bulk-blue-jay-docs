# Post top containers to ArchivesSpace
!!! Tip
    The order you upload agents, top containers, and subjects does not matter, but it is important to upload all new entities before your archival objects.

!!! Tip
    For help running scripts, please see [Create entity scripts](../python-scripts/running-the-scripts.md) help page.

## Steps
1. Use `postTopContainers.py` to post top containers in `top-container-template.csv` to ArchivesSpace.
