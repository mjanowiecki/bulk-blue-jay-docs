## A note on examples

Throughout this documentation, the Blue Jay Example Collection is used to help explain our workflow in greater detail. This collection is entirely fictitious and does not represent best archival practices. Instead, the examples were formulated for their ability to clarify data entry and workflows, rather adherence to best practices in DACS or other descriptive practices.
